# React-Wars-Carousel (Desktop)
This is a refactored version of a React challenge with a Netflix-esque carousel in React hooks. React Star Wars Carousel is for a DESKTOP and was bootstrapped with npx create-react-app. It can be integrated with a previous star wars project that pulls data from the start wars API and maps character qualities.
